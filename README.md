# ARMLAB
This brielfy highlights some of the example code that I used for the Joint Tracking Units that I worked on developing. This work was done as undergraduate research at Georgia Tech, ARMLab (The Adaptive Robotic Manipulation (ARM) Laboratory).

During my two semesters of working, I wrote many smaller test scripts, but I have chosen to focus on my most important pieces of code. Within this repository, I have also included my custom libraries (I2C, and SPI). Almost all of the code is written in Arduino C/C++, with the custom libraries mainly in C++.

I have additionally included the final IEEE paper that I wrote highlighting my research.
