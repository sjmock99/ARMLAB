# ARMLAB
This brielfy highlights some of the example code that I used for the Joint Tracking Units that I worked on developing. This work was done as undergraduate research at Georgia Tech, ARMLab (The Adaptive Robotic Manipulation (ARM) Laboratory).

During my two semesters of working, many smaller scripts were included, but these custom libraries and scripts highlight the most important piece of code that I developed and used.

I have additionally included the final IEEE paper that I wrote highlighting my research.
